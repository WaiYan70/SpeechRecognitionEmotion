## This machine learning Project is used and built for school projects/ assignment 

- For Programming language, I use Python and i used numpy for arraning arrays like matrices and for pandas to manipulate and analyze the data and so on. 

- For raw data or dataset, I used the "Kaggle" for sample data.

After downloading the sample data from "kaggle", it needs to give the path with 'os' library to access the sample data as code is mentiion in notebook.

The file structue and code are shown in below image
